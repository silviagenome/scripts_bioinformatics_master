Further study showed that overexpression of PFAL promoted cell proliferation. migration. and fibroblast-myofibroblast transition. Overexpression further resulted in extracellular matrix deposition and fibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts through regulation of microRNA-18a (miR-18a). Importantly. knockdown of PFAL alleviated lung fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically. our study showed that PFAL promoted lung-fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis by acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-18a: forced expression of PFAL inhibited the expression and activity of miR-18a. whereas silencing of PFAL had the opposite effect. Furthermore. we found that miR-18a was decreased during lung fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. as well as in patients with IPF. Moreover. knockdown of miR-18a led to fibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts. whereas enhanced expression of miR-18a attenuated TGF-beta1-induced lung fibrosis by directly targeting the regulation of connecting tissue growth factor.,29683732,lncRNA PFAL promotes lung fibrosis through CTGF by competitively binding miR-18a,2018
